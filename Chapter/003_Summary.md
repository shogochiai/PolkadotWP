## まとめ

Polkadot is a scalable heterogeneous multi-chain. This
means that unlike previous blockchain implementations
which have focused on providing a single chain of varying
degrees of generality over potential applications, Polkadot
itself is designed to provide no inherent application functionality at all. Rather, Polkadot provides the bedrock
“relay-chain” upon which a large number of validatable,
globally-coherent dynamic data-structures may be hosted
side-by-side. We call these data-structures “parallelised”
chains or parachains, though there is no specific need for
them to be blockchain in nature.
In other words, Polkadot may be considered equivalent to a set of independent chains (e.g. the set containing
Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Namecoin and Bitcoin) except for two very important points:
